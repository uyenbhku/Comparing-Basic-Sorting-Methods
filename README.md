# Comparing Basic Sorting Methods
<a name="intro"></a>
## **INTRODUCTION**
This small project is to compare the speed of 10 sorting methods, namely: 
*    Bubble Sort 
*    Interchange Sort
*    Insertion Sort
*    Selection Sort
*    Quick Sort
*    Merge Sort
*    Radix Sort
*    Shell Sort
*    Shaker Sort 
*    Heap Sort

## **PROBLEM**
The problem that this project solves is determined by the following input and output:
*    **INPUT:** 
        + an integer 'n' represents for the size of the array
        + n positive intergers in a random order
*    **OUTPUT:**
        + Files containing integers sorted in ascending order. 
            Though every file (should) contains the same content, each file represents for a sorting method
        + A floating point number representing time execution of each sorting method in the given number of integers

## CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE RESULTS OF COMPARATIONS    
The comparations are based on two following factors: 
+    1. Time of each sorting method costs to sort a certain number of elements 
+    2. The number of elements
