# Comparing Basic Sorting Methods
 This small project is to compare the speed of 10 sorting methods, namely: 
    1. Bubble Sort 
    2. Interchange Sort
    3. Insertion Sort
    4. Selection Sort
    5. Quick Sort
    6. Merge Sort
    7. Radix Sort
    8. Shell Sort
    9. Shaker Sort 
    10. Heap Sort 
    
The problem that this project solves is determined by the following input and output:
    - INPUT: 
        + an integer 'n' represents for the size of the array
        + n positive intergers in a random order
    - OUTPUT: 
        + Files containing integers sorted in ascending order. 
            Though every file (should) contains the same content, each file represents for a sorting method
        + A floating point number representing time execution of each sorting method in the given number of integers
    
The comparations are based on two following factors: 
    1. Time of each sorting method costs to sort a certain number of elements 
    2. The number of elements
